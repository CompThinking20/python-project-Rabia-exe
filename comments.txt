This is, right now, doing the most basic version of what you want, which is great for this stage of the project. From here, in order to get full points for the remaining portion of the project, you probably need to add features and increase complexity. I would recommend doing so by adding some sense of user input and interaction. How might someone influence the outcome or request some particular kind of output?
